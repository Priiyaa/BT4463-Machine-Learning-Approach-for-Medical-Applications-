# BT4463-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Medical-Applications
<br>
This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques for the precise detection of changes in red blood cells utilizing various input parameters, including wavelength, refractive index, TM, DA2, and Tg. The primary aim is to predict core mode and core loss, vital indicators of red blood cell alterations, from these input parameters.

The machine learning algorithms employed include: 
<br>
 <br>

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Utilized for its proximity-based classification technique in predicting changes in red blood cell characteristics. 

XGBoost: Employed for its optimized gradient boosting capabilities, enhancing predictive accuracy through ensemble learning. 

Support Vector Regression (SVR): Utilized for its capacity to handle non-linear regression tasks in predicting core mode and core loss. 

Decision Tree: Utilized for its hierarchical tree structure, facilitating the interpretation and prediction of red blood cell alterations. 

# Evaluation Metrics
To assess the accuracy and efficacy of our machine learning models, we employed the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as our primary evaluation metric. MSE was selected due to its ability to quantify the average squared differences between predicted and actual values, providing a robust measure of model accuracy.

Among the algorithms tested, KNN, XGboost and SVR demonstrated the highest performance in accurately predicting core mode and core loss based on the input parameters. Furthermore, for core mode there was least deviation between predicted and actual value whereas for core loss there was a large deviation between the two values.
